# MATLAB-Rocket_Selection_Program

This project is a MATLAB-based tool that identifies feasible rockets based on
user-defined payload mass, target orbit, launch location and cost constraints.

## Features
- User input for payload mass, orbit, and budget
- Filters rockets based on performance constraints
- Generates cost per pound of payload plot
- Displays detailed rocket performance information

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Excel

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Run `rocket_selector.m`
3. Follow the on-screen prompts
